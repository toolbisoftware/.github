# Toolbi

One is enough. We are that one.

## About us

Founded in 2020, Toolbi is a project led by [@soynexz](https://github.com/soynexz). Our goal is to create, re-create and improve amazing things.

Our main focus is to build better software, apps, tools, etc., than the already existing ones.

## Open Source

In October 13th of 2023 we decided to move (or build from the ground up) all our projects from private to open source, and we couldn't be happier!

This change has allowed us to simplify our workflow and use GitHub's free tools for public repositories.

We are still new in this **open source** world so if you want to help us a bit don't hesitate on contacting us!

## FAQ

**Q: Why "One is enough. We are that one."?**

> A: It means that we are able to create things that could replace all the others. We are yet to show off the veracity of the slogan but for now we will keep it.
